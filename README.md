## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/undg/simple-page-with-t3
cd simple-page-with-t3
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

To simplify setting up the demo environment, `db.sqlite` and `.env` files are committed to the repository. This is, of course, a shortcut that is not suitable for a production project.

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
